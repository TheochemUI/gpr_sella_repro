#+end_export
A *pure-python* project to generate input files for various common
computational chemistry workflows. This means:
- Generating input structures for ~jobflow~ / Fireworks
  + From unified ~toml~ inputs

This is a spin-off from ~wailord~ ([[https://wailord.xyz][here]]) which is meant to handle aggregated
runs in a specific workflow, while ~pychum~ is meant to generate *single runs*.
It is also a companion to ~chemparseplot~ ([[https://github.com/haoZeke/chemparseplot][here]]) which is meant to provide
uniform visualizations for the outputs of various computational chemistry
programs.
** Features
- Jobflow support
  + Along with Fireworks
- Unit aware conversions
  + Via ~pint~
*** Supported Engines
- NEB calculations
  + ORCA
  + EON
- Single point calculations
  + ORCA
  + EON
** Rationale
I needed to run a bunch of systems. ~jobflow~ / Fireworks / AiiDA were ideal,
until I realized only VASP is really well supported by them.

Also there were some minor problems with the ORCA input parser...
- It chokes on multiple ~#~ symbols, so ~# MaxIter 50 # something~ will error
  out on ~SOMETHING~
- No real ordering or syntax highlighting in major IDEs

Along with other minor inconveniences which make for enough friction over time
to necessiate this library.
* Usage
The simplest usage is via the CLI:
#+begin_src bash
python -m pychum.cli
#+end_src
* Development
Before writing tests and incorporating the functions into the CLI it is helpful
to often visualize the intermediate steps. For this we can setup a complete
development environment including the notebook server.
#+begin_src bash
pixi shell
pdm sync
pdm run $SHELL
jupyter lab --ServerApp.allow_remote_access=1 \
    --ServerApp.open_browser=False --port=8889
#+end_src
Then go through the ~nb~ folder notebooks.
** Adding ORCA blocks
Changes are to be made in the following files under the ~pychum/engine/orca/~ folder:
- The relevant ~.jinja~ file in the ~_blocks~ directory
- The configuration loading mechanism in ~config_loader.py~
- The ~dataclasses~ folder
- A sample test ~.toml~ file under ~tests/test_orca~
While working on this, it may be instructive to use the ~nb~ folder notebooks.
Also all PRs must include a full test suite for the new blocks.
** Documentation
*** Readme
The ~readme~ can be constructed via:
#+begin_src bash
./scripts/org_to_md.sh readme_src.org readme.md
#+end_src
